### Steps I made in order to make this work: 

1. Check for you local config settings.
  - git config --list
  - check your git config settings, especially the user.name and user.email properties
  - re-authenticate your git client with github using the credential manage. Remove if that is not the account associated with your local repo into the remote repo.
